                    Prior to my master`s program, I gained valuable industry experience as a Software Engineer Intern
                    at <i className="text-gray-100 font-semibold">TurboHire</i>. During my internship, I had the
                    opportunity to work on innovative projects, collaborate with talented professionals, and apply my
                    theoretical knowledge to practical, real-world problems. This experience not only honed my technical
                    skills but also taught me the importance of teamwork, problem-solving, and adaptability in a
                    fast-paced work environment.

                    In addition to my studies and professional experience, I am dedicated to sharing my knowledge with
                    others. I teach Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to individuals who are eager to learn and
                    improve their coding skills. Teaching DSA allows me to stay sharp in fundamental concepts while
                    helping others achieve their learning goals. It is incredibly rewarding to see my students grasp
                    complex ideas and succeed in their own academic and professional pursuits.

                    Overall, my background is a blend of rigorous academic training, hands-on industry experience, and a
                    passion for teaching. I am continuously seeking opportunities to learn, grow, and contribute to the
                    field of computer science.
